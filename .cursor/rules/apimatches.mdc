Cricket Info APIs
These APIs give you Details of each item shown in the List API
Details about series, matches, players, etc can be acquired through this API. Keep in mind that this API does NOT have pagination, so if there's a long list or a large API response you will need to handle it accordingly.


Series Info
Detailed info about the Series
